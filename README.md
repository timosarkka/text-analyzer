# Text Analyzer

This is a small python program that reads in a user-defined .txt-file and analyzes the contents.
It prints out a report (to terminal) that lists the word count, number of different letters and number of different words.

## Installation

Just clone the repository or download main.py and run the file from terminal.

## Usage

Should work great with plain text-files, such as these: https://www.gutenberg.org/
There are a couple of example files inside test-folder.
Just run the program and input the **relative** file path to the file you want to be analyzed.
